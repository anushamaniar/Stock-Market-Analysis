# Stock-Market-Analysis


This project provides tools for analyzing stock data and visualizing correlations with economic indicators through two main classes:

1. StockAnalysis: Obtains stock data from Yahoo Finance, computes Bollinger Bands, and identifies trading signals.
2. CorrelationVisualizer: Fetches economic indicator data from the FRED API and visualizes its correlation with stock prices.
